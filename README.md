# CST-205-Project-1 : https://github.com/jjsullivan5196/CST-205-Project-1
medianfinal.py is/will be the final result of this project. It's commented and everything for it to work is present in the source file. The rest is for arhive:

* marksimilarities.py -- Marks similar pixels with a selected color
* flipx.py -- Translates pixels over the x axis
* flipxclean.py -- Clean version of flipx.py
* medianhex.py -- A less-correct hex-based version of medianfinal, gives surprising results

Original images are located in images/originals use the folder to test the application.

Also, for funsies:

* medianPillow.py -- Same method as medianfinal.py, except it uses Python 3 and the Pillow PIL-fork instead of JES. **Runs 75% faster!**

If I could have, I would have wanted to turn this one in as the final version, as it works much better than medianfinal.py. They both essentially do the same thing, but medianPillow seems to be faster and more correct.

Results for the various programs are organized in images/results. Originals are in images/originals.
